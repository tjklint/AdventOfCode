# AdventOfCode Solutions by TJ

#### Please note: I use AdventOfCode as a learning tool, for practical challenges that allow me to test my knowledge using a variety of languages and paradigms.
### Languages used (written 2023/10/10):

1) **C++** I have never taken a C++ course, as of October 2023. My classes primarily take place with C# and JS. This was a challenge I set for myself to get better at a variety of language, and get used to the syntax of the language.

> Fun fact: I learned C++ to do some tutoring for some Engineering students at Toronto Metropolitan University.

#### 2022

#### 2020
I was not programming when AoC 2020 was released. I returned to it as a challenge from the competitive hacking club from my school.
