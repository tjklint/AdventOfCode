# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **Advent of Code** challenges, an annual programming event held every December. Each problem is solved in a separate file, named according to the day and part of the challenge.

You can find the challenges at `https://adventofcode.com/`, and I encourage you to support the creator via AoC++ if you enjoy the challenges!

## **Organization**

The repository is organized into folders based on the year of the challenge:

- `2023`: Solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code problems.
- `2022`: Solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code problems.
- `2021`: Solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code problems.
- And so on...

Each year's folder contains subfolders or files organized by day:
- `day01/` contains solutions for Day 1.
- `day02/` contains solutions for Day 2.
- Files for each day may include separate parts (`part1` and `part2`), or be consolidated into one file.

## **How to Use**

Feel free to browse through the solutions for inspiration, reference, or study purposes. If youâ€™d like to:
- Explore how I approached specific problems, start by navigating to the folder of the relevant year and day.
- Submit questions, suggestions, or optimizations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## **Disclaimer**

These solutions are provided for **educational purposes**. While I strive for correctness and efficiency, these solutions may not always be the most optimal. I encourage you to solve the problems yourself first, understand the challenges, and use this repository as a guide or for brainstorming ideas.


Happy coding, and enjoy the Advent of Code! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
